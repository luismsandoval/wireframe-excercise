## Wireframe Excercise

This is a wireframe that I constructed using CSS for a client. The client can use this to make any requested edits.

## Reflections and Comments

- I am still having a hard time working with CSS. Just doing a lot of trial and error to see what works for me.

- It was nice to be able to build out a webpage from scratch based on just a wireframe sketch from a client. I am no designer, so I imagine I would have a hard time coming up with what looks good.
